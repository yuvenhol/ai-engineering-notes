# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is a GitBook project documenting the transition from traditional software development to AI-driven systems. The content is written in Chinese (Simplified) and covers topics including:

- Software 1.0 vs 2.0 vs 3.0 paradigm shifts
- Prompt Engineering and Context Engineering
- RAG architecture design
- Agent system design
- AI system design principles
- Testing strategies and cost optimization for AI systems

## Publishing

This project uses GitBook for publishing. The `book.json` file contains the GitBook configuration:

- `structure.readme`: README.md (introduction)
- `structure.summary`: SUMMARY.md (table of contents)
- `structure.glossary`: GLOSSARY.md (optional, not yet created)

## Content Structure

- `SUMMARY.md` defines the table of contents - update this when adding new chapters
- `README.md` is the landing page
- Chapter files use Chinese filenames with Pinyin (e.g., `chuan-tong-kai-fa-vs-ai-kai-fa.md`)
- The main knowledge base is in `AI知识体系.md`

## File Naming Convention

Chapter files are named using Pinyin romanization of Chinese titles:
- `chuan-tong-kai-fa-vs-ai-kai-fa.md` (传统开发 vs AI 开发)
- `cong-que-ding-xing-dao-gai-shuai-xing.md` (从确定性到概率性)
- `prompt-engineering.md`
- `rag-jia-gou-she-ji.md` (RAG 架构设计)
